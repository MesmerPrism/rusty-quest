# Rusty Quest

Rusty Quest is the Morphospace lane for Quest platform behavior: runtime
profiles, Android property hygiene, permissions, launch planning, and platform
validation evidence.

This repo treats ADB and Android properties as transports. They are generated
from validated profiles and produce dry-run/readback evidence rather than
becoming hand-written launch authority.

## Validation

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\tools\check_all.ps1
```
