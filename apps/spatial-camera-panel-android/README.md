# Spatial Camera Panel Android

This app is a public Meta Spatial SDK lane for headset panel validation and
low-rate driver-profile control. It packages a Spatial SDK/Compose panel under
`io.github.mesmerprism.rustyquest.spatial_camera_panel`.

## Public Scope

- Spatial SDK panel registration, placement, scaling, and headlock controls.
- Low-rate participant/session files, Polar H10 intake records, ECG mirroring,
  block timing, and questionnaire JSONL artifacts.
- Raw Camera2/AHardwareBuffer projection probes and public blur/projection
  receipts.
- Generic driver profiles `profile-a` through `profile-d` with bounded
  `driver0_value01` and `driver1_value01` handoff markers.
- Native hand-anchor particle smoke tests that use public deterministic
  resident-mesh anchor billboards.

## Boundary

This app does not own high-rate renderer authority. It does not move hand mesh
frames, particle arrays, field buffers, private shader payloads, or replay
sequences through Kotlin/Java JSON. The public camera stack in this lane is raw
and blur/projection validation only. Private downstream visual semantics,
effect formulas, coupling kernels, and tuned parameter profiles belong outside
Rusty Quest.

## Known Follow-Up

The 2026-06-28 Quest 3S raw-color camera projection smoke passed the camera
stack gate: SDK-owned `SceneQuadLayer`, native Vulkan WSI, camera 50/51 streams,
target-rect clipping, and raw-color stereo output all rendered. A separate
vergence/focus mismatch remains: when the raw camera projection is brought into
comfortable focus, Meta system menus can appear doubled or soft. Treat that as a
future Rusty Lattice / projection-space alignment investigation, not as a
camera acquisition, HWB import, or WSI carrier failure.

## Native Receipt Source Map

- `app/src/main/.../SpatialCameraPanelActivity.kt` remains the Spatial SDK
  Activity facade: lifecycle, panel registration, scene tick routing, JNI
  calls, and route orchestration.
- `app/src/main/.../SpatialSdkLaneBoundary.kt` records the explicit route
  boundaries. Spatial SDK layer/panel primitives are the carrier substrate;
  experiment panel, camera projection, surface particles, and debug probes are
  separate consumers of that carrier.
- `app/src/main/.../ExperimentPanelController.kt` owns the Compose experiment
  panel UI and launcher UI. It may request panel visibility changes and
  low-rate particle-driver scalar updates, but it must not own camera frames,
  Vulkan WSI, SDK quad layers, or particle buffers.
- `app/src/main/.../SpatialCameraPanelModels.kt` owns shared panel placement,
  native-interop receipt, and low-rate control state models used by the
  Activity facade and panel UI.
- `app/src/main/.../SpatialAvatarHandVisualFeature.kt` owns suppression of the
  built-in Meta avatar hand visual so native/public hand visuals remain
  explicit.
- `native-receipt/src/camera_hwb_probe.rs` is the Android JNI facade and
  raw camera probe orchestration entry point.
- `native-receipt/src/camera_hwb_stream.rs` owns the Android Camera2 /
  `AImageReader` stream runtime, stereo camera 50/51 selection, private output
  size selection, and acquired `AHardwareBuffer` frame handoff.
- `native-receipt/src/camera_hwb_wsi.rs` owns the Vulkan WSI/resource helpers:
  surface-device selection, swapchain format/extent policy, sampled-HWB
  replacement import, descriptors, pipeline creation, command recording, and
  resource teardown.
- `native-receipt/src/camera_hwb_marker.rs` owns the raw camera probe marker
  channel and native log formatting helper.
- `native-receipt/src/camera_hwb_projection_target.rs` owns the public
  camera-projection target-rect constants, effective-rect formula,
  side-by-side packed UV rects, raw-color projection push constants, and marker
  field construction. Its host unit tests protect the target-rect behavior
  without requiring Android system libraries.
- `native-receipt/src/surface_particle_layer.rs`, `replay_hands.rs`, and
  `live_hand_joints.rs` remain Android-only surface-particle proof modules.

## Spatial SDK Lane Source Map

The Spatial SDK dependency is not a camera, particle, or experiment authority
by itself. Treat it as the Quest platform carrier for panels, layer placement,
surface creation, pose locking, sizing, and capability probes. Camera work
belongs in the Camera2/HWB projection modules, particle work belongs in the
surface-particle native modules, and panel/session work belongs in the Compose
panel controller plus store. Static validation checks that camera modules do
not reference particle internals, particle modules do not reference camera HWB
internals, and the panel controller does not directly own native start calls or
SDK quad/swapchain primitives.

## Validation

Run the static gate:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\tools\Test-SpatialCameraPanelAndroid.ps1
```

Build with:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\tools\Test-SpatialCameraPanelAndroid.ps1 -Build
```

The build wrapper writes
`target\spatial-camera-panel-android\rusty-quest-spatial-camera-panel.apk`
and `target\spatial-camera-panel-android\build-manifest.json`.

Run the raw camera projection headset smoke with:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\tools\Invoke-SpatialCameraPanelAndroidCameraHwbProjectionSmoke.ps1 `
  -Serial <quest-serial> `
  -ClearLogcat
```

The smoke enables `debug.rustyquest.spatial.camera_hwb_projection_probe`,
starts tag-filtered logcat before launch, captures the marker summary, window
state, and screenshot under `local-artifacts\spatial-camera-panel-headset`,
and leaves the projection running for visual inspection unless `-StopAfterRun`
is passed.
